# How to Reproduce Our Results

1) Download the python files: main.py and data_cleaning.py and upload them to a Python IDE like VS Code. You must also download the datasets: salary.csv, Master.csv, and players.csv which we will 
attach with our final project submission. You must use the ones that are in the folder we submit.
2) Upload all of the datasets to your environment so they can be accessed.
3) Install the pandas, seaborn and matplotlib libraries if not already installed
4) Run the data_cleaning.py and the main.py file
5) It should create 5 graphs and print the test_mean_squared_error in the terminal
